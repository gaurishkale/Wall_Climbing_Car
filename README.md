## Wall Climbing Car (Arduino Project)

This project demonstrates a wall-climbing robotic car built using Arduino technology. The vehicle is capable of defying gravity by sticking and moving along vertical surfaces. It combines simple electronic components with motor control logic to create an engaging and educational prototype for robotics enthusiasts.

### Features

* Wall Climbing Ability: Uses vacuum suction or fan-based mechanism to adhere to walls.
* DC Motor Control: Efficient movement using dual DC motors.
* Speed and Direction Control: Adjust speed and navigate with precision.
* Compact and Lightweight: Designed for vertical locomotion.

### Components Used

* Arduino Uno or Nano
* L298N Motor Driver Module
* 2x DC Motors
* Vacuum Pump or Suction Fan
* Power Supply (Battery pack)
* Chassis and wheels
* Jumper wires and connectors

### Files

* `wallClimbingCar.ino`: Main Arduino code controlling the robot's movement.
* `.gitattributes`: Git settings for proper text file handling.

### How It Works

The Arduino code controls two DC motors through the L298N motor driver. Depending on the input and power levels, the car can climb vertical surfaces while maintaining balance and grip using the suction mechanism.

### Educational Value

This project is ideal for students, hobbyists, and beginners looking to explore:

* Basic robotics
* Embedded systems
* Motor control using Arduino
* Real-world physics applications
